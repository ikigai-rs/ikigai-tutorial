# tic-tac-toe

The code taught by the book's applied arc: noughts and crosses designed as resources
before it is code, after *Resource Oriented Analysis and Design*, Parts 1–9, by Peter
Rodgers (NetKernel News 3.34–3.42, August–October 2012). The prose is
`books/ikigai/src/applied/tic-tac-toe-N.md`, one page per increment; the listings are
included from this crate by anchor.

The chapters are **drafts** until the whole arc is done: listed in
`books/ikigai/drafts.txt`, not in `SUMMARY.md`, because a merge to main deploys the book.
Read them with `./scripts/serve-with-drafts.sh`.

## The arc

Each increment is its own satellite, its own PR, and its own page. Brian reviews each on
the drafts server before the next is dispatched, and may reorder or cut what follows.

| Increment | Chapter content | Series parallel | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Name the sets on paper (the resource model); the atoms: a stored cell and the platonic empty cell; wire the game into the page's kernel; runnable cells | Parts 1–3 | done — `tic-tac-toe-1.md` |
| 2 | Composites: a set of cells by name, rows / columns / diagonals as zero-code `Alias`es, the board; one move recomputes one row and the board (trace shows it) | Part 4 | |
| 3 | Rules as resources: CheckSet (a representation that is a list of IRIs), winner, whose turn; constraint at the edge, model kept loose | Parts 6–7 | |
| 4 | Many games: the game as context (a `Scope` corridor) versus the game in the name — argue it | Part 8 | |
| 5 | A playable board in the page over the same kernel; the wrap-up | Parts 5, 9 | |

## What increment 1 left for the next ones

- **Names.** `urn:iki:tutorial:ttt:stored:{x}:{y}` (endpoint `ttt-stored`: Source /
  Sink / Delete) and `urn:iki:tutorial:ttt:cell:{x}:{y}` (endpoint `ttt-cell`: Source).
  The chapter's table also *plans* `row:{y}`, `column:{x}`, `diagonal:{n}`, `board`,
  `checkset:{x}:{y}`, `turn` and `winner` under `urn:iki:tutorial:ttt:`. Each carries an
  `urn-gate: unbound` directive in `tic-tac-toe-1.md`; binding one makes that directive
  fail, which is the reminder to delete it. Renaming one means editing the table.
- **Coordinates are any `i64`, in one spelling.** `01`, `+1`, `-0` are refused
  (`InvalidArgument`), because two names over one cell would be two golden threads over
  one piece of state. A composite that builds cell names should use `cell_name` /
  `stored_name`, which spell them the accepted way.
- **Writes go to `stored`, reads to `cell`.** The platonic cell is Source-only on
  purpose — see the chapter. A later increment that wants one name for both should argue
  it, because a forwarded Sink would cut the platonic cell's own thread and hide the
  failed-sub-request dependency the first chapter is about.
- **The page kernel is `book_wasm::page_space()`**: `Fallback([hello_camel::space(),
  tic_tac_toe::space()])`. New endpoints bound in `space_over` appear in the page and in
  the URN gate with no further wiring.
- **Cells are pinned by reading the chapter.** `book-wasm`'s
  `the_tic_tac_toe_cells_answer_as_the_chapter_says_in_page_order` parses every
  `data-cmd` and expected `<pre>` out of `tic-tac-toe-1.md`, runs them in page order
  against one kernel, and compares. A new page wants the same test pointed at it.
- ⚠ **A trace does not show a failed sub-request** (core 0.1.78). `trace
  urn:iki:tutorial:ttt:cell:2:2` on an unplayed cell prints one node — the stored cell's
  `NotFound` read, although it is a cache dependency, is not a span. Played, the same
  trace shows the child. Increment 2's "the trace shows it" will want played cells, or
  a sentence saying why an empty cell's trace is one line.
